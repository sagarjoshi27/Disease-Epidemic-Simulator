# Disease-Epidemic-Simulator
A Disease Epidemic Simulator has been developed using C++ and SFML in Visual Studio. 
The program uses the SIR model which is a mathematical model used for simulating epidemics with great accuracy. 
The program graphically represents the UKâ€™s residents using a different colored pixel for individuals with a different relation to the disease such as infected, immune etc.
The program simulates a disease epidemic with accuracy and represent the infection visually to the user.
